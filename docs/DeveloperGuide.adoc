== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletepet 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Calendar Component in UI
image::UiCalendarDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the DisplayList Component in UI
image::UiDisplayListDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` class that is made up of parts which can be classified broadly into 2 groups:

* (Group 1) Parts that are always displayed at all times, which include `CommandBox`, `FeedbackDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. These parts appear above `MainWindow` in the class diagram for UI.
* (Group 2) Parts that are selectively displayed, depending on the command entered by the user. Only some of these parts will be shown at any one instance. These include the `Calendar` and `DisplayList` components, and `OverallStatistics`. These parts appear beneath `MainWindow` in the class diagram for UI.

All the UI classes, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

In addition, each UI part has been styled using CSS. The custom CSS styling rules are defined in multiple CSS stylesheets, which can be found in the `src/main/resources/view/stylesheets` folder.

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data to update the UI with the modified data.
* Handles a returned `CommandResult` to perform additional actions, e.g. show the help window, exit the program, display the appropriate part or component from Group 2, etc.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PetTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a pet).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletepet 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletepet 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeletePetCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Pet Tracker data. Note that the Pet Tracker keeps track of both the schedule system and the pet system.
* exposes an `ObservableList<Pet>`, an `ObservableList<Slot>`, and an `ObservableList<FoodCollection>` that are unmodifiable and can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/clzzz/helper/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pet Tracker data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::display[]
=== Display
==== Implementation

The display mechanism is facilitated by an `ObservableList` of `DisplayItem` called `filteredDisplayItems`, which is an attribute stored in `ModelManager`.

Any class that is to be displayed as an item in a list implements the `DisplayItem` interface. This interface has a single method named `getDisplaySystemType` which returns the type of system to be displayed. In our program, the `Pet`, `Slot` and `FoodCollection` classes implement this interface.

Step 1. The user opens the app the the 1st time. A few things happen at start-up:

- In `Model` (`ModelManager`), `filteredDisplayItems` is created, and is set to bind to `filteredPets`. This way, `filteredDisplayItems` contains all the elements of `filteredPets`, and any changes to `filteredPets` will also be automatically propogated to `filteredDisplayItems`.

- In the `MainWindow`, a `DisplayListPanel` and a `CalendarPanel` are initialized. The `DisplayListPanel` is created with `filteredDisplayItems` as its backing list, while the `CalendarPanel` will be initialized with the `List` of `Slot`s obtained from `logic.getPetTracker().getSlotList()`.

- The `resultDisplayPlaceholder` component in the `MainWindow` is set to display the `DisplayListPanel`. As such, the user sees the list of pets as the initial display.

The following \____ diagram summarises Step 1 and shows what happens at initialization: (WIP)

image::displayDiagram1.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `display s` to have the **s**lots displayed in a list. The `display` command calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem`, which causes `filteredDisplayItems` to be re-binded to `filteredSlots` instead. Because the display is still making use of `DisplayListPanel`, no change is made to `resultDisplayPlaceholder` afterwards.

Step 3. The user executes `display c` to have the slots displayed in **c**alendar view. Since `filteredDisplayItems` is not used for displaying the calendar, it is not changed when the `display` command calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem`. Upon receiving back the result of the command in `MainWindow`, `resultDisplayPlaceholder` is changed to display the `CalendarPanel` instead of the `DisplayListPanel`.

Step 4. The user executes `display p` to view the list of **p**ets. The `display` command calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem`, which causes `filteredDisplayItems` to re-binded to `filteredPets`. Since the program should now display a list of items instead of a calendar, upon receiving back the result of the command in `MainWindow`, `resultDisplayPlaceholder` is changed to display the `DisplayListPanel` from `CalendarPanel`.

The following \____ diagram shows how the display operation works: (WIP)

image::displayDiagram2.png[]

// end::display[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule feature
==== Implementation

The schedule feature uses instances of class `Slot` to organise bathing schedule for the pets. Each `Slot` contains a
starting time of the bath, stored internally as a `LocalDateTime`, and the duration of the bath stored internally as a
`Duration`. It stores a reference to the `Pet` in the `ModelManager` as specified by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Schedule` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with some pets stored (`Garfield`, for instance). `ObservableList<Slot>`
in `Schedule` is currently empty.

Step 2. The user executes `addslot n/Garfield t/1/4/2020 1200 d/120` command to create a `Slot` for `Garfield`.
The `AddSlotCommandParser` calls `parsePet()` in `SlotParserUtil`, which then takes in the `Model` passed in to find a
reference for the specific `Pet` with `Model.getPet()`. Prior to this stage, if the name string is invalid, a
`ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_PETNAME)` will be thrown. Or the program cannot find the `Pet` in the model, a
`ParseException(MESSAGE_PET_DOES_NOT_EXIST)` will be thrown. This ensures that every slot created actually points to an
existing `Pet` found in `PetTracker`.

[NOTE]
If `parsePet()` fails its execution, no new `Slot` is created.

Step 3. New `Slot` is created.

Step 4. The user now decides that this exact slot should be occupied by another pet, and decides to edit it, executing
the `editslot` command.

Step 5. `SlotParserUtil` is used again to create a reference to a pet in the `ModelManager`.

Step 6. The user now decides that they need to see slots occupied by a particular pet on a particular date, executing
the `findslots n/Garfield t/1/4/2020` command.

Step 7. The `FindSlotCommand` reduces the two predicates* and pass it to `ModelManager` to create a filtered list of
slots.

*The `FindSlotCommand` uses the following classes which both inherit `Predicate<Slot>` to search for the user specified
slots:

* `SlotPetNamePredicate()` -- Internally stores the `Name` to search for, and compares it with
`getPet().getName().fullName`.
* `SlotDateTimePredicate()` -- Internally stores the `LocalDateTime` to search for (Timing will be ignored), and
compares it with `getDate()`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How schedule stores the pets internally

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Makes a reference to the the memory address in `ModelManager` .
** Pros: When the pet is edited, the slot is also updated.
** Cons: Hard to implement and test.
* **Alternative 2:** Simply create a new Pet.
** Pros: Easy to implement and test (A refactor of `Pet`), low coupling with `Model`.
** Cons: Does not update when original pet is edited, which is not something the user will expect.

// end::schedule[]

// tag::intentoryfeature
=== Inventory feature
==== Implementation

The Inventory feature gives a summary of all the food items involved in a pet tracker system.
It is supported by `FoodCollection` which resembles a collection of food of the same type and `FoodCollectionList` which is a list of these collections.
A `FoodCollectionList` is stored as an attribute of `UniquePetList` for the following reasons:

* The list of `FoodCollection` items associated with a `UniquePetList` can be directly derived from the `UniquePetList` itself.
* Changes in FoodCollection occurs only if there is a change in `UniquePetList#internalList`.

Data stored in `FoodCollectionList` is exposed to `ModelManager` through `UniquePetList` and `PetTracker` as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<FoodCollection>`.
`ModelManager` then passes the list of `FoodCollection` to ui for display as a list of `DisplayItem` when `display i` is called.

The following shows a typical usage scenario that involves the Display Inventory feature.

* Step 1: The user launches the application. A `UniquePetList` is initialized in `PetTracker`, upon which a `FoodCollectionList` item is created to store the food data of the pets in the list(if it is an empty list, `FoodCollectionList` is also stores an empty list of `FoodCollection`)
* Step 2: The user executes 'display i' command. The `display` command calls Model#ChangeDisplaySystem() and the `i` display type determines the displayed list is switched to `ObservableList<FoodCollection>`. `Model$getFilteredDisplayList()` then acquires the list and sends it to Ui unit for display.
* Step 3: The user inputs a command that modifies the `UniquePetList`, e.g 'editpet 1 f/catfood:100'. `UniquePetList$internalList` is an instance of `ObservableList<Pet>`. Thus when it is modified, a `ListChangeListener<Pet>` is woken up and it calls `UniquePetList$updateFoodCollectionList()` to update the `FoodCollectionList` according to the modified Pet list.

The sequence diagram below is an illustration of the flow of events that happen in the logical component when `Step 2` above occurs.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `display i` Command
image::DisplayInventorySequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Maintaining the collection of food in a pet tracker
* Alternative 1(current choice): Maintains the list as an attribute of `UniquePetList`.
** Pros: Easier to initialize and update the list.
** Cons: Less extendability. Adding additional food items in inventory(independent of pet list) is difficult.

* Alternative 2: Maintains a list of food collections separate from `UniquePetList`.
** Pros: Higher Extendability that supports more independent operations of FoodCollection List.
** Cons: More difficult to constantly update and maintain the food collection list should food list changes.

===== Aspect: Updating the collection of food when pet list is modified.
* Alternative 1(current choice): Replace the entire list by a new food collection list created from the updated pet list.
** Pros: Easy to implement and no adaptation is required for different types of modification of pet list.
** Cons: Computationally intensive when there is a huge pet list.

* Alternative 2: Modify `FoodCollection` affected by the command.
** Pros: Less computationally intensive and more responsive given a large database.
** Cons: Adaptations for each pet related commands is required since the food list can be affected in different ways.(e.g addition, modification, deletion)
// end::intentoryfeature

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of
just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Statistics

We are generating the overall statistics of Pet Store Helper and translate the data in a user-friendly manner.

* `OverallStatistics` under UI component handles the translation of three sets of data: list of pets, schedule, and list of inventory.
* Data is obtained from `Logic`.

How we implemented overall statistic on UI:

* The statistics for pets are shown in a form of pie chart, while the pets are grouped according to their species.
* The schedule statistics is in the form of a timetable of recent 3 days. Each slot is represented as a shaded rectangle in the timetable.
* The inventory data are generated from the list of pets, and grouped together by their names, such that users have a better understanding of overall food consumption. The list of inventory is represented as a bar chart.
