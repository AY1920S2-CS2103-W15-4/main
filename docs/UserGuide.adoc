== Introduction

Pet Store Helper (PSH) is for owners of pet shops who **prefer to use a desktop app for managing their store**. More importantly, PSH is **optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PSH can help you get your work done faster than traditional GUI apps.

It is based on 2 main systems, one that manages pets, and another one that organises showering schedules.
