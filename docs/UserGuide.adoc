== Introduction

Pet Store Helper (PSH) is for owners of pet stores who **prefer to use a desktop app for managing their store**. More importantly, PSH is **optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PSH can help you get your work done faster than traditional GUI apps.

It is based on 2 main systems, one that manages pets, and another one that organises showering schedules.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `petStoreHelper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Pet Shop Helper.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

* `display s` : Displays the current schedule as a list of slots.
* `addslot n/Teddy t/16/11/2020 1300 d/90`: Adds a new showering slot for Teddy with details as given.

.  Refer to <<Commands>> for details of each command.


[[Features]]
== Features

=== Pet Tracker System

Details about each pet kept track of are its name, gender, species, date of birth and dietary requirements. In addition, tags for each pet may also be added.

==== Pet Food Inventory

This shows the a list of all pet food (inventory) and the needed amount per week. Double-click on each food item to view the breakdown for each pet individually.

=== Schedule System

There are 2 ways of displaying the slots tracked by the schedule system: either sequentially as a list of slots, or in the form of a calendar view.

==== Slots list view

Slots displayed here are arranged in chronological order, with the earliest slot displayed first. In the case where multiple slots start at the same time, the slot with the shortest duration is shown first. 

==== Calendar view

Slots that fall on the same day are displayed on the same row. They are then positioned horizontally according to the time they start. The width taken up by each slot in this view is proportional to its duration.

If there are conflicted slots, then the time period in which these conflicted slot lie in is simply rendered as single "conflicted" slot.

=== Statistics

The statistics of the pet store shown are:

- The proportion of species of pets,
- The planned schedule for the next 3 days, and
- A breakdown of how many of each type of pet food is needed in a week.
